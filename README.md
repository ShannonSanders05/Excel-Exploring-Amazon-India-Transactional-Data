## Project Title: Excel-Exploring-Amazon-India-Transactional-Data

**Description**:

In this project, I delved into Amazon India transaction data, specifically focusing on delivery information. The key steps in exploring and reporting on the extracted system data include:

1. **Data Preparation**: Initiated the project by cleaning and preparing the dataset, ensuring accuracy and reliability for subsequent analyses.
2. **VLOOKUP Function**: Utilized the VLOOKUP function to enhance the dataset by integrating additional relevant information, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of transaction details.
3. **Pivot Table Creation**: Employed Excel's pivot tables to organize and summarize the data, providing a structured view of transaction trends and distribution status per region.
4. **Data Visualization**: Applied data visualization techniques to create insightful charts and graphs. This facilitated a dynamic representation of transaction trends and shipping fee variations across different regions, offering a clearer perspective.
